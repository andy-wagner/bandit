# Bandit Algorithms

Inspired by [Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027393.do) I've implemented some bandit algorithms in Java and a test framework to quickly visualize how they behave under different scenarios.

Currently, the algorithms available are: epsilon-Greedy, Softmax and UCB1.
